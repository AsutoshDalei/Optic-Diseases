# Ocular Diseases Classification using Deep Learning Techniques
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the classification of retinal images to identify various eye diseases. The focus is on four specific conditions: **Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract, and Glaucoma**. 

By analyzing these images, we can assist in early diagnosis and treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project comprises retinal images categorized into four classes:
* Normal: Healthy retinal images with no abnormalities
* Diabetic Retinopathy: Images showing signs of diabetic eye disease.
* Cataract: Images indicating the presence of cataracts in the lens of the eye.
* Glaucoma: Images that reveal signs of glaucoma, which affects the optic nerve.

Each class contains approximately 1,000 images, providing a balanced dataset for training and evaluation. The images have been sourced from various reputable databases, including:

* IDRiD: Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset
* Ocular Recognition: A database focused on ocular disease recognition
* HRF: High-Resolution Fundus dataset
